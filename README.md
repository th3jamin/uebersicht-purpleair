# uebersicht-purpleair

A Übersicht widget to show the current AQI for your region using the [Purple Air API](http://api.purpleair.com/).

## Setup
  * You will need an Api key which can be requested from Purple Air. They don't seem to have an online way to do this so you can shoot a quick email to contact.purpleair.com they respond very fast.
  * Determine the bounding box, NW lat/long - SE lat/long for the area you want to scrape for sensors. I use Google maps for this, right click at any point and select "What's Here", then you will see the lat/long for that location.
